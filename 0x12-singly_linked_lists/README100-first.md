The __attribute__((constructor)) is a GCC-specific attribute that allows you to specify a function to be executed automatically before the main function is invoked. This attribute is used to define a constructor function, which is executed during program startup.


The function marked with __attribute__((constructor)) is commonly referred to as a "constructor function" because it is responsible for initializing certain aspects of the program before the main function is executed. It provides a way to perform any necessary setup or initialization tasks before the program starts its normal execution.
